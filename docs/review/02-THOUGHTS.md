The user wants me to review their project proposal for a new internet mail system called "The Federizer Project". I need to go through the entire document and identify areas that are unclear, potentially problematic, or simply worth discussing further. My expertise is in OAuth 2.0 and email systems, so I should focus my questions on those aspects.

Here's a breakdown of my thinking process:

1. **High-Level Understanding:**  The project aims to replace the traditional email system with one based on OAuth 2.0 principles. Key concepts are Placeholder Messages, External Resources, Contextual Discharge, and leveraging OAuth 2.0 for authorization and data access.

2. **Placeholder Message and External Resources:** The idea of a Placeholder Message acting as an ACL and referencing external resources is interesting and deviates from traditional email. I should ask about the motivation and potential drawbacks of this approach. How are the external resources identified and located?

3. **Contextual Discharge:** The concept of a chain of signed Placeholder Messages for access control needs clarification. How does this chain prevent replay attacks or unauthorized access with older messages?

4. **Acronyms and Components:** This section is straightforward and provides context for the subsequent details. No immediate questions here.

5. **OAuth 2.0 Flow:**  The use of Authorization Code Grant with PKCE for user interactions and Token Exchange with DPoP for service-to-service interactions seems like a good fit for the described scenarios. I should inquire about the specific motivations for choosing these grant types and any considerations for refresh tokens in the service-to-service flow.

6. **Client Registration:** The registration of different components as public or confidential clients is generally correct.

7. **Service Discovery:** The use of DNS SRV records is interesting, especially the note about redirect services. I should ask about the security implications of the redirect service and alternative discovery mechanisms considered. The reliance on the sibling MTX resource server for client metadata is a bit unusual and warrants further questioning.

8. **Conceptual Example:** The example clarifies the interaction flow. I need to understand how the SHA-256 digests in the `Content-ID` headers relate to fetching the external resources. Is the digest used as a key?

9. **Digital Assets:** The signing of Placeholder Messages and individual external resources is a positive security feature. I might ask about the key management strategy.

10. **Resource(s) Delivery Scenario:** This scenario illustrates the core workflow. It's mostly clear, but I should double-check the authorization flow between the MTAs and MBXs.

11. **Sequence Diagrams:**  These diagrams provide a detailed view of the OAuth 2.0 flows. I'll need to carefully review each diagram for correctness and consistency with the described logic.
    * **Authorization Code Grant:** Seems standard.
    * **Cross-Domain Authorization Grant (Placeholder Message Transfer):**  The use of the "message_digest" claim is the core of the DKIM replacement. I should ask about the security analysis of this approach.
    * **Cross-Domain Authorization Grant (External Resource Fetching):**  The dependency on the Signed Placeholder Message as an ACL for fetching is crucial. I need to confirm my understanding of this mechanism.
    * **Cross-Domain Authorization Grant (Relaying/Forwarding):** The chronological appending of JWT Assertions needs careful consideration regarding size and processing overhead.

12. **Project Implementation:** The technology choices are reasonable. I should ask about the rationale behind SQLite and the specifics of the synchronization protocol.

**Overall Strategy:** My approach is to go through the document section by section, identifying key concepts and asking clarifying questions. I will focus on the OAuth 2.0 aspects, especially the Token Exchange flow, DPoP, and the use of JWT assertions. I'll also question the non-standard elements like Placeholder Messages and Contextual Discharge to understand the motivations and potential challenges. I will avoid making assumptions and explicitly ask for clarification on anything that isn't immediately clear.
