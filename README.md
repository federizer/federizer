# Federizer

## Introduction

Email has long been the main way to exchange important information. It is used as an interpersonal communication tool and often as a default choice to send files. Despite its central role, the email ecosystem still relies on a 50-year-old architecture and outdated protocols.

We introduce Federizer, a federated communications system built on a modernized architecture. It empowers users to exchange messages, documents, books, images, videos, and audio via Internet mail. By redefining the foundation of email, Federizer brings the efficiency, security, and scalability needed for today's communication demands.
